# Internet Design Project 3: Implementing API
This webpage is an extension of my previous project. It is a page that contains a collection of silly social media posts and a feed of Donald Trump's tweets to encourage the reader to stop using social media. The posts illustrate how absurd social media can be and also offers a link to the Web 2.0 Suicide Machine to make it easier for readers to free themselves.
